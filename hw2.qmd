For this assignment, we will be using the [Abalone dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of physical measurements of abalone (a type of marine snail) and includes information on the age, sex, and size of the abalone.

We will be using the following libraries:

```R
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(cowplot)
```
```{R}

## Question 1
::: {.callout-tip}
## 30 points
EDA using `readr`, `tidyr` and `ggplot2`
:::

###### 1.1 (5 points)

Load the "Abalone" dataset as a tibble called `abalone` using the URL provided below. The `abalone_col_names` variable contains a vector of the column names for this dataset (to be consistent with the R naming pattern). Make sure you read the dataset with the provided column names. 

```R
library(readr)
url <- "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data"

abalone_col_names <- c(
  "sex", 
  "length", 
  "diameter", 
  "height", 
  "whole_weight", 
  "shucked_weight", 
  "viscera_weight", 
  "shell_weight", 
  "rings"
)

abalone <- ... # Insert your code here
```
```{R}
library(readr)
url <- "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data"

abalone_col_names <- c(
  "sex", 
  "length", 
  "diameter", 
  "height", 
  "whole_weight", 
  "shucked_weight", 
  "viscera_weight", 
  "shell_weight", 
  "rings"
)

abalone <- read_csv(url, col_names = abalone_col_names)
```


---

###### 1.2 (5 points)

Remove missing values and `NA`s from the dataset and store the cleaned data in a tibble called `df`. How many rows were dropped?

```R
df <- ... # Insert your code here
```

```{R}
df <- abalone %>%
  drop_na()

rows_dropped <- nrow(abalone) - nrow(df)
rows_dropped
```



---

##### 1.3 (5 points)

Plot histograms of all the quantitative variables in a **single plot** [^footnote_facet_wrap]

```R
... # Insert your code here
```
```{R}
df_long <- pivot_longer(df, cols = -sex, names_to = "variable", values_to = "value")

quantitative_vars <- df_long[df_long$variable %in% abalone_col_names, ]

histogram_plot <- ggplot(quantitative_vars, aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Histograms of Quantitative Variables") +
  theme_minimal()

histogram_plot
```


---

##### 1.4 (5 points)

Create a boxplot of `length` for each `sex` and create a violin-plot of of `diameter` for each `sex`. Are there any notable differences in the physical appearences of abalones based on your analysis here?

They have different physical shapes. For example, one is a box plot and the other is a violin plot. However, their overall shapes are similar. 

```R
... # Insert your code for boxplot here
```
```{R}
boxplot_length <- ggplot(df, aes(x = sex, y = length)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Length by Sex", x = "Sex", y = "Length") +
  theme_minimal()

boxplot_length
```

```R
... # Insert your code for violinplot here
```
```{R}
violin_diameter <- ggplot(df, aes(x = sex, y = diameter)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Violin Plot of Diameter by Sex", x = "Sex", y = "Diameter") +
  theme_minimal()

violin_diameter
```


---

###### 1.5  (5 points)

Create a scatter plot of `length` and `diameter`, and modify the shape and color of the points based on the `sex` variable. Change the size of each point based on the `shell_wight` value for each observation. Are there any notable anomalies in the dataset?

1 sex: I is an outlier on the graph

```R
... # Insert your code here
```
```{R}
scatter_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x = length, y = diameter, shape = sex, color = sex, size = shell_weight)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("F" = 16, "M" = 17, "I" = 15)) +  
  scale_color_manual(values = c("F" = "blue", "M" = "red", "I" = "green")) +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Length and Diameter by Sex",
       x = "Length",
       y = "Diameter",
       shape = "Sex",
       color = "Sex",
       size = "Shell Weight") +
  theme_minimal()

scatter_plot
```

---

###### 1.6 (5 points)

For each `sex`, create separate scatter plots of `length` and `diameter`. For each plot, also add a **linear** trendline to illustrate the relationship between the variables. Use the `facet_wrap()` function in R for this, and ensure that the plots are vertically stacked **not** horizontally. You should end up with a plot that looks like this: [^footnote_plot_facet]


```R
... # Insert your code here
```
```{R}
scatter_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x = length, y = diameter, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +  
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Length and Diameter by Sex",
       x = "Length",
       y = "Diameter") +
  facet_wrap(~sex, nrow = 3) +  
  scale_color_manual(values = c("F" = "red", "M" = "blue", "I" = "green")) +
  theme_minimal()

scatter_plot
```

## Question 2
::: {.callout-tip}
## 40 points
More advanced analyses using `dplyr`, `purrrr` and `ggplot2`
:::


---

###### 2.1 (10 points)

Filter the data to only include abalone with a length of at least $0.5$ meters. Group the data by `sex` and calculate the mean of each variable for each group. Create a bar plot to visualize the mean values for each variable by `sex`.


```R
df %>% ... # Insert your code here
```
```{R}
filtered_df <- df %>% 
  filter(length >= 0.5)

mean_values <- filtered_df %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise_all(mean)

mean_values_long <- pivot_longer(mean_values, cols = -sex, names_to = "variable", values_to = "mean_value")

bar_plot <- ggplot(mean_values_long, aes(x = variable, y = mean_value, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Mean Values of Variables by Sex",
       x = "Variable",
       y = "Mean Value",
       fill = "Sex") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

bar_plot
```


---

###### 2.2 (15 points)

Implement the following in a **single command**:

1. Temporarily create a new variable called `num_rings` which takes a value of:

  * `"low"` if `rings < 10`
  * `"high"` if `rings > 20`, and
  * `"med"` otherwise

2. Group `df` by this new variable and `sex` and compute `avg_weight` as the average of the `whole_weight + shucked_weight + viscera_weight + shell_weight` for each combination of `num_rings` and `sex`. 

3. Use the `geom_tile()` function to create a tile plot of `num_rings` vs `sex` with the color indicating of each tile indicating the `avg_weight` value. 


```R
df %>% ... # Insert your code here
```
```{R}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(num_rings = case_when(
    rings < 10 ~ "low",
    rings > 20 ~ "high",
    TRUE ~ "med"
  ))

df_avg_weight <- df %>%
  group_by(num_rings, sex) %>%
  summarise(avg_weight = mean(whole_weight + shucked_weight + viscera_weight + shell_weight))

tile_plot <- ggplot(df_avg_weight, aes(x = sex, y = num_rings, fill = avg_weight)) +
  geom_tile(color = "black") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "darkblue") +
  labs(title = "Average Weight by num_rings and Sex",
       x = "Sex",
       y = "Number of Rings",
       fill = "Average Weight") +
  theme_minimal()

tile_plot
```



---

###### 2.3 (5 points)

Make a table of the pairwise correlations between all the numeric variables rounded to 2 decimal points. Your final answer should look like this [^footnote_table]


```R
df %>% ... # Insert your code here
```
```{R}
correlation_table <- df %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  cor(use = "pairwise.complete.obs") %>%
  round(., 2)

correlation_table
```



---

###### 2.4 (10 points)

Use the `map2()` function from the `purrr` package to create a scatter plot for each _quantitative_ variable against the number of `rings` variable. Color the points based on the `sex` of each abalone. You can use the `cowplot::plot_grid()` function to finally make the following grid of plots.

:::{.content-visible when-format="html"}
![](images/plot_grid.png)
:::


```R
... # Insert your code here
```
```{R}
library(purrr)
library(cowplot)

quantitative_vars <- df %>%
  select_if(is.numeric)

scatter_plots <- map2(quantitative_vars, names(quantitative_vars), function(var, name) {
  ggplot(df, aes_string(x = "rings", y = name, color = "sex")) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = paste("Scatter plot of", name, "vs. Rings"),
         x = "Rings",
         y = name,
         color = "Sex")
})

grid <- plot_grid(plotlist = scatter_plots, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

grid
```

## Question 3
::: {.callout-tip}
## 30 points

Linear regression using `lm`
:::

---

###### 3.1 (10 points)

Perform a simple linear regression with `diameter` as the covariate and `height` as the response. Interpret the model coefficients and their significance values. 

The intercept coefficient is about -0.0038. Meaning when the diameter is 0 the mean height is -0.0038

The diameter is approx. 0.3514 meaning for every unit increase in diameter the height is expected to increase by approx 0.3514
```R
... # Insert your code here
```
```{R}
model <- lm(height ~ diameter, data = df)

model
```



---

###### 3.2 (10 points)

Make a scatterplot of `height` vs `diameter` and plot the regression line in `color="red"`. You can use the base `plot()` function in R for this. Is the linear model an appropriate fit for this relationship? Explain. 


```R
... # Insert your code here
```
```{R}
plot(df$diameter, df$height, xlab = "Diameter", ylab = "Height", main = "Scatterplot of Height vs Diameter")

model <- lm(height ~ diameter, data = df)

abline(model, col = "red")

legend("topright", legend = "Regression Line", col = "red", lty = 1, cex = 0.8)

```



---

###### 3.3  (10 points)

Suppose we have collected observations for "new" abalones with `new_diameter` values given below. What is the expected value of their `height` based on your model above? Plot these new observations along with your predictions in your plot from earlier using `color="violet"`

```R

new_diameters <- c(
  0.15218946,
  0.48361548,
  0.58095513,
  0.07603687,
  0.50234599,
  0.83462092,
  0.95681938,
  0.92906875,
  0.94245437,
  0.01209518
)


... # Insert your code here. 
```
```{R}
new_diameters <- c(
  0.15218946,
  0.48361548,
  0.58095513,
  0.07603687,
  0.50234599,
  0.83462092,
  0.95681938,
  0.92906875,
  0.94245437,
  0.01209518
)

new_predictions <- predict(model, newdata = data.frame(diameter = new_diameters))

plot(df$diameter, df$height, xlab = "Diameter", ylab = "Height", main = "Scatterplot of Height vs Diameter", col = "black")
abline(model, col = "red")

points(new_diameters, new_predictions, col = "violet", pch = 19)
legend("topright", legend = c("Data", "Regression Line", "New Observations"), col = c("black", "red", "violet"), pch = c(1, NA, 19))
